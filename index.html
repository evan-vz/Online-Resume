        <p>
            I am a young professional who is looking to expand my career and skills. I have experience in working alongside and leading individuals and teams, customer service / hospitality and the wider coffee industry. I have great interest in Information technology and have studied Web development and am currently furthering my education into software development. I take interest in topics that have a lot of depth to them as they provide me with a challenge to uncover their intricacies.

        <h3>Short summary.</h3>
            <p> I started out by studying web development back in 2018, then middle 2019 started working as a Barista at a local coffee shop.
                I worked hard and learnt as mucha as I could till I became the head barista over a year later and two years later managed one of the branches and roasted coffee for the franchise.
                From there I moved on to another coffee shop and further worked on my craft later to compete in the national barista competition.
                Soon after that I joined a larger Roastery where I focused more on the production behind the scenes.
                <br>
                Now I'm here getting back to coding and learning more about web development.<br>
                Time to conqour a new industry!
